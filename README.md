**Selection**

30% of the population, tournament with pool size with of 10.

**Crossover**

80% of crossover, with the crossover operation from A Fast TSP Solver Using Genetic Algorithm in Java.

**Mutation**

30% of the new population mutate with a reverse path.

**Convergence criteria**

The algorithme stop executing itself if since 50 generations the best result hasn't changed.
